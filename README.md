# Golden Apples

Golden Apples is a logical human vs computer game where the rules are as follows: There are 3 bags and inside each bag there are 10 apples. In each turn, you can withdraw 1-5 balls from a bag then it's the computer's turn. The winner is the one who withdraws the last ball from the 30 balls in total. I programmed it in a way where I covered a lot of cases to make it difficult to win so try it out!

This game was originally just a simple question in my university's Semester 1 Intro to cs course 2017 final exam where the computer's turn should be just a random play. This was my first cs course and I was practicing for my final exam when I came across this question and liked it so I decided to take it a step further and create the logic for the computer's turn.
